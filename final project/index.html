            <h3>Fried Chicken Trivia</h3>
            <aside>
                <details>
                    <summary>When did fried chicken first appear in the United States?</summary>
                    <p>Fried chicken first appeared in the United States during the <mark>18th century</mark>. It is
                        believed to have
                        been introduced by <mark>Scottish immigrants who brought their tradition of deep-frying chicken
                            in fat
                            or oil to America.</mark> Over time, the dish evolved and became popular in the Southern
                        states, where
                        it gained its iconic status. Southern-style fried chicken is typically seasoned with a variety
                        of spices, coated in flour or batter, and then deep-fried to a crispy golden brown. It has since
                        become a beloved classic in American cuisine, often served with sides like biscuits, coleslaw,
                        and mashed potatoes.
